# Wishlist-App

Fourth Wish, created by Team Genie, is a tool to help streamline the process of gift-giving by allowing users to create a shareable wishlist. Users can share lists with friends/family by entering the email they used to create an account. Users can check off any item they have bought for the recipient and that item will become “bought” for all others the list is shared with. The recipient of gifts will not know if an item is bought so all gifts received will still be a surprise.
